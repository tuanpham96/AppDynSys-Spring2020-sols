The peer review is structured as follows, similar to a referee report, so you know that too:

First paragraph states what the project is about from a high level, not a detailed one. This is to make clear to the author of the project report that you got their main messages.

Second paragraph is about what is interesting about the investigation and topic. Hopefully you find something interesting or challenging about the subject! State what that is.

Third paragraph is about what is confusing, challenging, or difficult with reading the project report. This will help the other student know where to put efforts into improving their presentation.

Fourth paragraph is about what you are curious about. This might suggest some further investigation to the other student. And is a good exercise in asking questions about research topics.

Report ends with any minor concrete suggestions or points, if you have some. This can be things like ``Label figures" or ``This quantity wasn't defined" or ``What numerical scheme did you use", etc.
